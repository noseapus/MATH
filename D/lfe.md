**Definition:** Let $f$ be a family of $M$ [generative models](/D/gm) $m_1, \ldots, m_M$, such that the following statement holds true:

$$ \label{eq:fam}
f \Leftrightarrow m_1 \vee \ldots \vee m_M \; .
$$

Then, the family evidence of $f$ is the weighted average of the [model evidences](/D/ml) of $m_1, \ldots, m_M$ where the weights are the within-family [prior model probabilities](/D/prior)

$$ \label{eq:fe}
p(y|f) = \sum_{i=1}^M p(y|m_i) \, p(m_i|f) \; .
$$

The log family evidence is given by the logarithm of the family evidence:

$$ \label{eq:lfe}
\mathrm{LFE}(f) = \log p(y|f) = \log \sum_{i=1}^M p(y|m_i) \, p(m_i|f) \; .
$$
