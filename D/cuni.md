**Definition:** Let $X$ be a continuous [random variable](/D/rvar). Then, $X$ is said to be uniformly distributed with minimum $a$ and maximum $b$

$$ \label{eq:cuni}
X \sim \mathcal{U}(a, b) \; ,
$$

if and only if each value between and including $a$ and $b$ occurs with the same probability.
