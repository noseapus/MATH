**Definition:** Let there be a [statistical test](/D/test) of an [alternative hypothesis](/D/h1) $H_1$ against a [null hypothesis](/D/h0) $H_0$. Then,

* the test is called a one-tailed test, if $H_1$ is a [one-tailed hypothesis](/D/hyp-tail);

* the test is called a two-tailed test, if $H_1$ is a [two-tailed hypothesis](/D/hyp-tail).

The fact whether a [test](/D/test) is one-tailed or two-tailed has consequences for the computation of [critical value](/D/cval) and [p-value](/D/pval).
