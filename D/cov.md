**Definition:** The covariance of two [random variables](/D/rvar) $X$ and $Y$ is defined as the [expected value](/D/mean) of the product of their deviations from their individual [expected values](/D/mean):

$$ \label{eq:cov}
\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \mathrm{E}\left[ (X-\mathrm{E}[X]) (Y-\mathrm{E}[Y]) \right] \; .
$$
