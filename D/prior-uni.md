**Definition:** Let $p(\theta \vert m)$ be a [prior distribution](/D/prior) for the parameter $\theta$ of a [generative model](/D/gm) $m$ where $\theta$ belongs to the parameter space $\Theta$. Then,

* the distribution is called a "uniform prior", if its [density](/D/pdf) or [mass](/D/pmf) is constant over $\Theta$;

* the distribution is called a "non-uniform prior", if its [density](/D/pdf) or [mass](/D/pmf) is not constant over $\Theta$.
