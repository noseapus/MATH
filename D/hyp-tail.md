**Definition:** Let $H_0$ be a [point](/D/hyp-point) [null hypothesis](/D/h0)

$$ \label{eq:h0-point}
H_0: \; \theta = \theta_0 \;
$$

and consider a [set](/D/hyp-point) [alternative hypothesis](/D/h1) $H_1$. Then,

* $H_1$ is called a left-sided one-tailed hypothesis, if $\theta$ is assumed to be smaller than $\theta_0$:

$$ \label{eq:h1-tail1-left}
H_1: \; \theta < \theta_0 \; ;
$$

* $H_1$ is called a right-sided one-tailed hypothesis, if $\theta$ is assumed to be larger than $\theta_0$:

$$ \label{eq:h1-tail1-right}
H_1: \; \theta > \theta_0 \; ;
$$

* $H_1$ is called a two-tailed hypothesis, if $\theta$ is assumed to be unequal to $\theta_0$:

$$ \label{eq:h1-tail2}
H_1: \; \theta \neq \theta_0 \; .
$$
