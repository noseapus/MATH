**Definition:** Let $A$ and $B$ be two arbitrary statements about [random variables](/D/rvar), such as statements about the presence or absence of an event or about the value of a scalar, vector or matrix. Then, $p(A,B)$ is called the joint probability of $A$ and $B$ and is defined as the [probability](/D/prob) that $A$ and $B$ are both true.
