**Definition:** Beta-distributed data are defined as a set of proportions $y = \left\lbrace y_1, \ldots, y_n \right\rbrace$ with $y_i \in [0,1], \; i = 1,\ldots,n$, independent and identically distributed according to a [Beta distribution](/D/beta) with shapes $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

$$ \label{eq:beta-data}
y_i \sim \mathrm{Bet}(\alpha,\beta), \quad i = 1, \ldots, n \; .
$$
