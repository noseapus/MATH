**Definition:** Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be [independent](/D/ind) [random variables](/D/rvar) following a [chi-squared distribution](/D/chi2) with $d_1$ and $d_2$ [degrees of freedom](/D/dof), respectively:

$$ \label{eq:chi2}
\begin{split}
X_1 &\sim \chi^{2}(d_1) \\
X_2 &\sim \chi^{2}(d_2) \; .
\end{split}
$$

Then, the ratio of $X_1$ to $X_2$, divided by their respective degrees of freedom, is said to be $F$-distributed with numerator degrees of freedom $d_1$ and denominator degrees of freedom $d_2$:

$$\label{eq:F}
Y = \frac{X_1 / d_1}{X_2 / d_2} \sim F(d_1,d_2) \quad \text{where} \quad d_1, d_2 > 0 \; .
$$

The $F$-distribution is also called "Snedecor's $F$-distribution" or "Fisherâ€“Snedecor distribution", after Ronald A. Fisher and George W. Snedecor.
