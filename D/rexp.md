**Definition:** A random experiment is any repeatable procedure that [results in one](/D/rvar) out of a well-defined set of possible outcomes.

* The set of possible outcomes is called [sample space](/D/samp-spc).

* A set of zero or more outcomes is called a [random event](/D/reve).

* A function that maps from events to probabilities is called a [probability function](/D/dist).

Together, [sample space](/D/samp-spc), [event space](/D/eve-spc) and [probability function](/D/prob-spc) characterize a random experiment.
