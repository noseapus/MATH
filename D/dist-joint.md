**Definition:** Let $X$ and $Y$ be [random variables](/D/rvar) with sets of possible outcomes $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. Then, a joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ is a [probability distribution](/D/dist) that specifies the probability of the event that $X = x$ and $Y = y$ for each possible combination of $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and $y \in \mathcal{Y}$.

* The joint distribution of two scalar [random variables](/D/rvar) is called a bivariate distribution.

* The joint distribution of a [random vector](/D/rvec) is called a multivariate distribution.

* The joint distribution of a [random matrix](/D/rmat) is called a matrix-variate distribution.
