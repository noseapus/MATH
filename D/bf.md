**Definition:** Consider two competing [generative models](/D/gm) $m_1$ and $m_2$ for observed data $y$. Then the Bayes factor in favor $m_1$ over $m_2$ is the ratio of [marginal likelihoods](/D/ml) of $m_1$ and $m_2$:

$$ \label{eq:BF}
\text{BF}_{12} = \frac{p(y\mid m_1)}{p(y\mid m_2)}.
$$

Note that by [Bayes' theorem](/P/bayes-th), the ratio of [posterior model probabilities](/D/pmp) (i.e., the posterior model odds) can be written as

$$ \label{eq:odds}
\frac{p(m_1 \mid y)}{p(m_2 \mid y)} = \frac{p(m_1)}{p(m_2)} \cdot \frac{p(y\mid m_1)}{p(y\mid m_2)},
$$

or equivalently by \eqref{eq:BF},

$$ \label{eq:odds2}
\frac{p(m_1 \mid y)}{p(m_2 \mid y)} = \frac{p(m_1)}{p(m_2)} \cdot \text{BF}_{12}.
$$

In other words, the Bayes factor can be viewed as the factor by which the prior model odds are updated (after observing data $y$) to posterior model odds â€“ which is also expressed by [Bayes' rule](/P/bayes-rule).
