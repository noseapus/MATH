**Definition:** In a [statistical hypothesis test](/D/test), the [critical value](/D/cval) $t_\mathrm{crit}$ is that value of the [test statistic](/D/tstat) $T(Y)$ which partitions the set of possible test statistics into "acceptance region" and "rejection region" based on a [significance level](/D/alpha) $\alpha$. Put differently, if the observed test statistic $t_\mathrm{obs} = T(y)$ computed from actually [measured data](/D/data) $y$ is as extreme or more extreme than the critical value, the test rejects the [null hypothesis](/D/h0) $H_0$ in favor of the [alternative hypothesis](/D/h1).
