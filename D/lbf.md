**Definition:** Let there be two [generative models](/D/gm) $m_1$ and $m_2$ which are mutually exclusive, but not necessarily collectively exhaustive:

$$ \label{eq:m12}
\neg (m_1 \land m_2)
$$

Then, the Bayes factor in favor of $m_1$ and against $m_2$ is the ratio of the [model evidences](/D/ml) of $m_1$ and $m_2$:

$$ \label{eq:bf}
\mathrm{BF}_{12} = \frac{p(y|m_1)}{p(y|m_2)} \; .
$$

The log Bayes factor is given by the logarithm of the Bayes factor:

$$ \label{eq:lbf}
\mathrm{LBF}_{12} = \log \mathrm{BF}_{12} = \log \frac{p(y|m_1)}{p(y|m_2)} \; .
$$
