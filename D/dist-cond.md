**Definition:** Let $X$ and $Y$ be [random variables](/D/rvar) with sets of possible outcomes $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$. Then, the conditional distribution of $X$ given that $Y$ is a [probability distribution](/D/dist) that specifies the probability of the event that $X = x$ given that $Y = y$ for each possible combination of $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and $y \in \mathcal{Y}$. The conditional distribution of $X$ can be obtained from the [joint distribution](/D/dist-joint) of $X$ and $Y$ and the [marginal distribution](/D/dist-marg) of $Y$ using the [law of conditional probability](/D/prob-cond).
