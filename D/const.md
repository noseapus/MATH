**Definition:** A constant is a quantity which does not change and thus always has the same value. From a statistical perspective, a constant is a [random variable](/D/rvar) which is equal to its [expected value](/D/mean)

$$ \label{eq:EX}
X = \mathrm{E}(X)
$$

or equivalently, whose [variance](/D/var) is zero

$$ \label{eq:VarX}
\mathrm{Var}(X) = 0 \; .
$$
