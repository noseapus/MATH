**Definition:** Let $X$ be a [random variable](/D/rvar) and let $n$ be a positive integer. Then, the $n$-th raw moment of $X$, also called ($n$-th) "crude moment", is defined as the $n$-th [moment](/D/mom) of $X$ about the value 0:

$$ \label{eq:mom-raw}
\mu_n' = \mu_n(0) = \mathrm{E}[(X-0)^n] = \mathrm{E}[X^n] \; .
$$
