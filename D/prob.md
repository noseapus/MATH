**Definition:** Let $E$ be a statement about an arbitrary event such as the outcome of a [random experiment](/D/rexp). Then, $p(E)$ is called the probability of $E$ and may be interpreted as

* (objectivist interpretation of probability:) some physical state of affairs, e.g. the relative frequency of occurrence of $E$, when repeating the experiment ("Frequentist probability"); or

* (subjectivist interpretation of probability:) a degree of belief in $E$, e.g. the price at which someone would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if $E$ and 0 if not $E$ ("Bayesian probability").
