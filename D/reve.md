**Definition:** A random event $E$ is the outcome of a [random experiment](/D/rexp) which can be described by a statement that is either true or false.

* If the statement is true, the event is said to take place, denoted as $E$.

* If the statement is false, the complement of $E$ occurs, denoted as $\overline{E}$.

In other words, a random event is a [random variable](/D/rvar) with two possible values (true and false, or 1 and 0). A [random experiment](/D/rexp) with two possible outcomes is called a [Bernoulli trial](/D/bern).
