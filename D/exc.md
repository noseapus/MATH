**Definition:** Generally speaking, [random events](/D/reve) are mutually exclusive, if they cannot occur together, such that their intersection is equal to the [empty set](/P/prob-emp).

<br>
More precisely, a set of statements $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ is called mutually exclusive, if

$$ \label{eq:exc}
p(A_1, \ldots, A_n) = 0
$$

where $p(A_1, \ldots, A_n)$ is the [joint probability](/D/prob-joint) of the statements $A_1, \ldots, A_n$.
