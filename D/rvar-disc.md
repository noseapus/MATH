**Definition:** Let $X$ be a [random variable](/D/rvar) with possible outcomes $\mathcal{X}$. Then,

* $X$ is called a discrete random variable, if $\mathcal{X}$ is either a finite set or a countably infinite set; in this case, $X$ can be described by a [probability mass function](/D/pmf);

* $X$ is called a continuous random variable, if $\mathcal{X}$ is an uncountably infinite set; if it is absolutely continuous, $X$ can be described by a [probability density function](/D/pdf).
