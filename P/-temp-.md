**Theorem:** Let there be [something](/D/-temp-). Then

$$ \label{eq:Theorem}
\textbf{an equation belonging to the theorem}
$$

if $\textbf{some conditions}$ are fulfilled.


**Proof:** Given [something](/D/-temp-), it holds that

$$ \label{eq:Proof}
\textbf{an equation belonging to the proof}
$$

which completes the proof of \eqref{eq:Theorem}.
